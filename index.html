                            The U.S. Government (with France and a few other U.S. allies) bombs Libya, Syria, etc.; and the U.S. regime refuses to accept
                            any of the resulting refugees — the burdens from which are now breaking the EU, and the EU is sinking in economic competition
                            against America’s international corporations. America’s corporations remain blithely unscathed by not only the refugees that
                            are breaking up the EU, but also by the EU’s economic sanctions against Russia, Iran, and other allies of governments that the
                            U.S. regime is trying to overthrow in its constant invasions and coups. The U.S. Government makes proclamations such as “Assad
                            must go!” — but by what right is the U.S. Government involved, at all, in determining whom the leaders in Syria will be? Syria never invaded the U.S. In fact, Syria never invaded anywhere (except, maybe, Israel, in order to respond against Israel’s invasions). Furthermore, all polling, even by Western pollsters, shows that Bashar al-Assad would easily win any free and fair election in Syria. The U.S. Government claims to support democracy, but it does the exact opposite whenever they want to get rid of a Government that is determined to protect that nation’s sovereignty over its own national territory, instead of to yield it to the U.S. regime, or to any other foreigners. The U.S. regime has virtually destroyed the United Nations.
